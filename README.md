# MakingALargerIsland
LeetCode 827. Making A Larger Island in Java

So far this has been the hardest problem I have solved in LeetCode.
When I read the description I figured the key was to figure out
how to grow the islands.

If inteerested in this problem, please visit the LeetCode site and
read the current description. It seems that it could change in time.

If you are still integersted, I invite you to read the following post
in my blog:

I describe my approach and implementation.

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to lear is to read and experiment.

Enjoy;

John
